## About the data

PA County addresses from http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/MetadataDisplay.aspx?entry=PASDA&file=PAMAP_BuildingPoint2007.xml&dataset=3

This data was compiled in a 2009 project by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Most counties provided point locations of building structures. Some counties also provided useful address information for those points.
